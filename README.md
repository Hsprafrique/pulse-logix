# AI-Powered Logistics App

## 🚀 Overview
An intelligent logistics coordination platform that connects **merchants** with **dispatch riders** in real-time. Designed for speed, accessibility, and efficiency — with features tailored for the African market.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Merchants struggle with unreliable dispatch systems, while dispatch riders miss job opportunities due to lack of real-time tools. This app bridges that gap with an AI-enhanced platform that:

- Allows merchants to create, assign, and track delivery jobs
- Notifies riders *only when they’re online* and ready to accept tasks
- Supports local payments, scalability, and offline-friendly UX in future versions

---

## 👥 User Roles

### Merchant
- Register & log in
- Create jobs with pickup/drop-off info
- Track job progress
- Receive job notifications & receipts

### Dispatch Rider
- Register & log in
- Toggle online/offline availability
- Accept/reject jobs
- Update job status
- View earnings

### Admin (Optional)
- User management
- Job monitoring & analytics

---

## 📲 Core Features

- **Smart job assignment** — Riders only notified when online
- **Real-time updates** — Track jobs from creation to delivery
- **Status-based flow** — Each job moves through defined states: `created → assigned → in progress → completed`
- **Secure auth** — JWT or session-based login
- **Payment support** — Integration with local NGN payment gateways
